    <strong>XXXXX is one of the most self-confident applicants I've ever met, and I mean that in a good way.</strong>

<h2>Overall impression : </h2>
<p>
    <strong></strong>She's an involved, intelligent, focused young woman who is ready to hit the ground running once she arrives at school. She has visited Bates twice, taken a tour, and checked out Olin (which was VERY impressive to her.) She has already submitted her common application and I preparing the Bates supplement for submission. Bates is high on her list of schools.

<h2>Candidate extra interests : </h2>
<ol>
    <li>She is thoroughly involved in the choirs at her school (madrigal, concert choir, all-state, etc.)</li>
    <li>She also has a very keen interest in psychology and has already completed a study and has submitted it for publication in the journal Sleep. </li>
    <li>Yes, I was a little surprised, too! She collected data this summer on second and third graders' sleep patterns and drew a negative correlation between sleep disorders and academic achievement in Math,Reading, and Writing. She wants to continue on this vein of research in college, as well as pursue a double major in voice. </li>
    <li>She also would like to study abroad (preferably in a French-speaking country) and was very excited to hear about all the opportunities at Bates.</li>
    <li><span></span>She also volunteers at the XXXXX Medical Center with ill children. She plays, reads, and just "hang out" </li>

<h2>Conclusion :</h2>
<p>
    I think XXXXX would not only enjoy the Bates experience, but would be an excellent addition to the Bates Community. She's very involved, bright, and driven.
